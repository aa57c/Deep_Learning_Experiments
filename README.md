# Deep Learning Experiments

A collection of hands-on deep learning projects exploring state-of-the-art architectures, custom models, and generative techniques. This repository demonstrates practical experience with Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and model fine-tuning.

## Highlights

* Fine-tuning and evaluation of pre-trained models (e.g., SegFormer, ResNet, VGG19)
* Object detection experiments with YOLO
* Custom neural network topologies and architecture design
* Data visualization and result analysis
* Generative model experiments

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aa57c/Deep_Learning_Experiments.git
cd Deep_Learning_Experiments
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*If no `requirements.txt` exists, install common packages like `torch`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.*

3. **Run an experiment**
   Open any Jupyter notebook, for example:

```bash
jupyter notebook experiment1.ipynb
```

## Notebooks Included
