- The generated image successfully blends the content with the target style while maintaining image coherence.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Neural style transfer can produce **visually appealing results** with pre-trained models and proper loss formulation.
- VGG19 features are effective for separating content and style.
- Iterative optimization allows **gradual refinement** and monitoring of the generated image.
